after npm install 
run ng serve. 
you will see 4 errors those are typescript type errors.
was not able to get rid of those something with the use of Map object type 
and the rxjs Array.from 
if u will just move to the search.component.ts and just save it. it will refresh 
and will allow you to test.
here is what was implemented:

1. read from mockup json file.
2. fill the region dropdown
3. fill the bankres dropdown
4. based on the region selection the L2APP drop down is filled with bankers from selected region and who has L2APP role
5. based on the region selection the L3APP drop down is filled with bankers from selected region and who has L3APP role
6. created user login/user sign in 
7. flip between the 2 (same component ) using animation.
